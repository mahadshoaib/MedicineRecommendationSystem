# HealthRecommendationSystem
A health recommendation system built using python and flask, which predicts the disease based on symptoms, and then recommends precautions, medications, diets, and workout.
The dataset was taken from kaggle.
Multiple ML models were trained (SVC, RandomForest, GradientBoosting, KNeighborsClassifier, MultinomialNB).
SVC was finalized.
Voice input also available.
